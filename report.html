My app is used for taking trips. When you need to fly somewhere you just put the airport you're flying out of, the airport you're flying to, the date you want to arrive and leave, and how many adults are going. It will then automatically retrieve all flights for those dates and display them. You can then decide if you want to filter the flights by "fastest", "best", and "cheap". It will also find the best hotels and list the top 5 in the area you're landing along with the price. 
I used 3 different api endpoints which you said was fine in class, they were to get the flights, to get the city id, and to get the hotels. 
I've attached two pictures showing the results at full screen and when it is to small just incase something breaks :(
